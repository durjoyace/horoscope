4. Notes for Replit Developer

“Remove all gradient boxes, neon colors, and heavy drop shadows. This should feel like a premium wellness product — clean, minimal, and trustworthy. Use the color palette and fonts provided. All sections should have generous padding and white space. Replace zodiac mascot illustrations with minimalist line icons or abstract symbols. Prioritize typography and layout for credibility.”
